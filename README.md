# Java Payroll Calculator

_A command-line Java application originally developed for a CS &141 assignment, now being refactored to apply modern programming practices._

## About This Project

The original assignment focused on using conditionals, loops, user input, and basic arithmetic to estimate net pay for salary and hourly employees.

It has since been revisited and is being refactored as part of a personal effort to reinforce core Java concepts, improve code structure, and explore clean design practices like modularization, method extraction, and eventually, MVC architecture.

This version retains the core functionality while improving readability, user experience, and maintainability â€” with future enhancements planned.


## Features

- Calculates gross and net pay for hourly and salary employees
- Handles overtime and fixed tax rate deductions
- Simple text-based UI with basic input validation
- Modular structure with ongoing improvements

## Tech Stack

- Java 17+
- Command-line interface (CLI)


## Planned Enhancements
- Improved error handling
- Restructure the project using a clear separation of concerns (MVC architecture)
- Add a detailed pay stub-style output, showing gross pay, deductions, overtime, and net income
- Support exporting results to common formats such as `.csv`, `.json`, or `.sql`
- Allow optional user-defined tax rates, with fallback to a default value
- Include more advanced calculations such as annual income projections or estimated deductions
- Explore basic state tax lookups or external data integration in the future
